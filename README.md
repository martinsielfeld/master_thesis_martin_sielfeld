<strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
<br>
The literature has pointed out that home-school distance is an attribute that discourages households to consider high quality alternatives that are distant from home when the apply for enrollment. This is a problem when the educational offer is heterogeneously distributed in space, leading to having a closer school offer that is dissimilar according to the household residence. Through a discrete choice model for estimating household’s preferences, this research studies the effect of the heterogeneous distribution of schools and the inability of households to compare the entire offer on the conformation of lists of preferred alternatives for households in Santiago de Chile. The methodology used allows to estimate for each household the utility level reported by different schools with different attributes. Comparing the school that maximize the utility level for each household with that reported as most preferred in the application system, it is possible to evaluate if households are comparing optimally or are missing relevant alternatives due to lack of information. Simulations are also carried out to: contrast the existence of educational poles or deserts; contrast the distribution of attribute values by simulating the allocation process, among others. The main findings suggest that households are not able to choose optimally, which results in selecting schools that would not maximize their utility level. Given the spatial heterogeneity of the educational offer and the preferences for school attributes, communes with high (poles) and low (deserts) demand are observed. When comparing a simulation of the admission process where households can compare the entire offer with the results of the actual admission system, a significant decrease in the distance to be covered by students is observed, as also a reduction in the gap of education quality accessed by students from different socioeconomic level.<br>

<strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
<br>
The School Choice system proposed by Friedman (1962) allows parents to choose among schools according to their preferences for school characteristics. Previous research (Hofflinger, 2020; Burgess et al., 2015; Hastings et al., 2009) has indicated that this decision depends, among other things, on the comparison of different school attributes: good teaching, the educational curriculum (religious or differential education, for example), the cost of access (tuition or monthly payment), among others. However, for households the lack of information on some alternatives, the residence location and the home-school distance can affect the preferences and the real accessible offer.<br>
<br>
These indications would pose a problem in educational markets where the value of school attributes and the level of information is heterogeneous in space, shaping access to a different educational offer depending on the place of residence. Therefore, it is relevant to study the consequences of the spatial heterogeneity in the access to educational offer, the conformation of the list of preferences, their associated utility levels and the attributes that determine them.<br>
<br>
As a contribution to the literature, this research studies how the place of residence and the omission of relevant alternatives can lead to a non-optimal selection of schools (according to the utility maximization criteria). The approach used allows to contrast, for each household, the estimated utility, and the values of the school attributes between the schools reported as preferred (in the admission process) and those they may have chosen in a context of complete information. If significant differences are found, these could show the effects of the lack of information in a School Choice system. Through extensions of the methodology, it is also possible to determine areas of high (poles) and low (deserts) demand, analyzing the average level of their school attributes. This would reveal those areas that lack of a good educational offer, conditioning households that live there to an unfavorable offer. Finally, by simulating the admission process for the case of households with complete information, it is possible to contrast the results of the distribution of school attributes with respect to those observed in the national admission system. By analyzing the changes, it may be possible to see social gains of delivering more information to households, so that they can choose optimally.<br>
<br>
To analyze the school characteristics that families find more relevant, this research will follow the literature of the "Random Utility Model" (McFadden, 1977). The empirical approach will be through a Conditional Logit of the first preference submitted by those households that applied for grades between pre-kindergarten and first grade in the city of Santiago in 2019. In order to study the hypothesis of heterogeneous preferences for school attributes, the model is also stratified according to the household socioeconomic level.<br>
<br>
The main findings regarding preferences confirm what is suggested by the previous literature, where attributes of schools such as home-school distance, monetary payments and high low-income students’ composition are undesirable by households. On the other hand, high levels of academic quality and religious teaching are positively valued by applicants. Given these preferences, and under the assumption that the model allows for the comparison of all alternatives (complete information), there are municipalities in the city that have an offer with undesirable attributes, while others have an offer with highly desirable attributes. This spatial heterogeneity of preferred schools represents a problem when distance is a barrier for accessing schools with better attributes, since it causes households with an undesirable nearby offer to see their possibility of opting for better alternatives outside their neighborhood reduced. Finally, by simulating the admission process under complete information, certain efficiency gains are observed when families are able to compare more alternatives, such as an average reduction of 48% in the distance traveled and a reduction in the SIMCE score gap between priority and non-priority students of 5 points (approximately).<br>
<br>
 <strong>2.0 THE CHILEAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM</strong><br>
<br>
It is prudent to introduce the influence of the School Choice model in the Chilean educational system. Over 40 years, it underwent two profound reforms focused on giving households greater choice power over their child’s education. The first reform, applied in the early 1980s, introduced the model through a voucher system in subsidized public founded schools (Gauri, 1999). This idea proposed to hand over decision-making power to households through a per-pupil attendance subsidy to schools (Friedman M., 1962). Families would apply to those schools that best fit their preferences, where a fundamental assumption was that households were utility maximizers. The goal of this model was for schools to compete for students through educational plans that were attractive to households, such as good teaching and learning, the educational curriculum, and low monetary costs. This would incentivize lower performing schools to improve the education quality or close.<br>
<br>
However, the literature has revealed multiple problems related to the model application. For example, the introduction of vouchers in the educational system may have had ambiguous effects, since there is insufficient evidence to affirm that it led to an improvement in the quality of public education (McEwan & Carnoy, 2000; Bronfman, 2007; McEwan, Urquiola, & Vegas, 2008). Another relevant problem was the growth on the selection power of schools with good academic performance, due to the excess demand for them. Between 1980 and 2015 schools were able (to some extent) select applicants. Through admissions tests, interviews, request for evidence of household income, or other signaling strategies, schools avoided students that could lower the school's academic performance. This power allowed them to select those students who could perform better in academic tests, which was strongly related to the student's socioeconomic level. Because of this, the socioeconomic distribution of students between schools evolved to one in which most of the high-income students attended to those schools with better educational quality, while more vulnerable students were enrolled in those with deficient quality.<br>
<br>
The second reform was implemented four decades later (2015). This reform included the creation of a new School Admission System (“Sistema de Admisión Escolar” or SAE), which aimed to eliminate the selection power of public schools. By delegating the student selection task to a computerized system with random components, selection and discrimination problems were avoided while maintaining the school choice system. Currently, families no longer need to apply in person to schools, but rather the process of selection and admission of establishments is done through a website that allows households to create a list of preferred schools (ranked). It should be mentioned that the selection of alternatives does not have restrictions in terms of application or distance to travel limits. Also, the Ministry of Education established categories of preferences during the admission process, such as giving preference to a certain number of low-income students. Together with the number of vacancies per school, the state's priority ranking, and the household's list of preferred schools determine the distribution of students among schools.<br>
<br>
Despite the specifications of the new admission system, recent evidence suggests that there was no significant change in the socioeconomic composition of schools within the first 5 years of operation. This situation could be due to high co-payment in schools with higher educational quality, being a barrier for low-income families (Sillard, Garay, & Troncoso, 2018). Another article states that this result is due to the minimum proportion (15%) of low-income students per school (Eyzaguirre, Hernando, Razmilic & Blanco, 2019). The researchers suggest that expanding it to 20% in the best performing schools could reduce access inequality to better education quality. They also point out that the lack of information on the admission mechanism and the available alternatives can condition the speed at which these changes occur in socioeconomic compositions.<br>
<br>
Although these researchers suggest multiple reasons that could explain the observed results, they also indicate that part of the effect may be due to household’s preferences for school characteristics, the difficulty of comparing all alternatives and school’s capacity restrictions. They suggest that the differences in information and close alternatives may lead to an unfavorable equilibrium state (in terms of utility maximization) for low-income families. Neilson, Allende & Gallego (2019) may corroborate this idea by pointing out that families from low-socioeconomic background who participated in an intervention (where they were helped to choose in a more informed way) were substantially benefited. On average, these households could have access to better quality schools, with these results being slightly reduced due to the school’s capacity constraints.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.0 DATA</strong><br>
<br>
To study household preferences for school characteristics, this research uses public and administrative data from the application process in new admission system (SAE for now on) provided by the national Ministry of Education. Households and Schools location is available, as well as attributes of students and alternatives. To address household’s socioeconomic heterogeneity, this research uses a block level Socioeconomic Index (“Índice Socioeconómico”) from the Adolfo Ibáñez University.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.1 Households and students</strong><br>
<br>
This research focuses on those 2019 applicants who applied to grades from pre-kindergarten to 1st grade in the city of Santiago. This supposes a group of 80,772 applicants, which represents 16.7% of the total applicants in 2019 and 56.6% of those residing in the city of Santiago<sup name="a1">1</sup>.<br>
<br>
The databases published by the Ministry of Education contain information of the students, as well as the list of schools nominated by each household and the order of preference. The available data contain information about the household’s location (longitude and latitude), grade to which it applies and a binary variable indicating whether the student is a priority student or not<sup name="a2">2</sup>. This label is assigned according to the household's socioeconomic level and is used as one of the approximations of its socioeconomic level. With the household’s location it is possible to compute the commune of residence and if the family lives in a rural or urban sector. Since perception of school characteristics may vary between households from urban and rural sectors (e.g., distance perception) and grades (e.g., older students may prefer better school quality to travel distance compared to younger students who need to be accompanied by their parents), the study focus on those students from pre-kindergarten to 1st grade who were living in the urban area of Santiago by the time they participated in the admission system. That means that, from the 483,070 students that applied to a school in 2019, 80,772 fit the described criteria.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.2 Schools</strong><br>
<br>
Since the households are in the urban sector of Santiago, the schools that represent the set of available alternatives to be chosen by them are limited to a similar territorial unit. This means, among other things, that households applying to schools in other regions or distant from the city are not considered in this study. However, it is possible to argue that households close to the urban limits can apply to nearby schools outside of said territorial unit (e.g., rural areas or suburbs). Consequently, and since on average students do not usually travel more than 2 kilometers away from home, schools that are within a maximum of 5 kilometers from the urban border are also included. Figure 1 plot the previous idea, where a buffer around the city of Santiago includes all the schools that are considered within the set of available alternatives. Given this, and since the research only consider those schools that dictate the grades from pre-kindergarten to 1st grade, the set of available alternatives in the school market corresponds to 1,211 establishments.<br>

<p align="justify">
Given the previous literature, each school includes information about several school characteristics. Available data include: SIMCE math test score (as a proxy for academic quality), monthly cost of co-payment<sup name="a3">3</sup>, proportion of priority students (as a continuous proxy for the school's socioeconomic composition), an index of whether the school has differential education<sup name="a4">4</sup> and another if it has religious education. Finally, the longitude and latitude of each alternative is included. This information allows to calculate the distance between each household and available school.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.3 Center of Territorial Intelligence</strong><br>
<br>
As an alternative measure of using priority students label as a proxy of household’s socioeconomic level, the socioeconomic percentile of household’s neighborhood from 2012 is used. The data comes from an index designed by the Center of Territorial Intelligence (“Centro de Inteligencia Territorial”), being part to the Adolfo Ibáñez University. For each block, this indicator considers the educational level of the head of the family, the house quality, and the acquired goods for its preparation.<br>
<br>
Since the household’s location has a random error level between 50 to 300 meters from the real location, the percentile of those blocks whose centroid is within a radius of 300 meters from the reported location are weighted. This allows an approximation to the family socioeconomic through spatial information.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.4 Statistic summary</strong><br>
<br>
Table 1 shows the characteristics and definitions of the variables to be used in this research. Table 2 shows a statistical summary of household’s previously described variables. Regarding the approximations of the household’s socioeconomic level, a proportion of 35.5% priority students are observed. On the other hand, the average socioeconomic percentile of the household’s neighborhood (within a radius of 300 meters) is 58.2%. It should be noted that according to the neighborhood’s socioeconomic percentile (external source to the one provided in the admission process), 16 applicants are lost due to lack of information.<br>

<br>
<p align="justify">
Regarding the characteristics of the available offer, Table 3 shows a statistical summary with the variables to be consider as relevant by the households. It is seen that 29.1% of these have an educational curriculum with religious education, while only 4% have differential education. Although more than 75% of the available schools do not have co-payment (since a part of these are municipal schools and another are private subsidized schools without co-payment), the average of $11,075 pesos observed is influenced by a significant co-payment amounts in the upper part of the distribution. For the case of the proportion of priority students within the schools, the distribution tends to a normal one with a mean of 46.1% of priority students and a standard error of 18.2 percentage points. Finally, the distribution of the SIMCE math test score has a slight positive bias to the right, concentrating the bulk of schools in values below the mean (252 points).<br>
